# PIPs
Peercoin Improvement Proposals (PIPs) describe standards for the Peercoin platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.

A browsable version of all current and draft PIPs can be found on [the official PIP site](https://peercoin.net/).

# Contributing
First review [PIP-10](PIPS/pip-10.md). Then clone the repository and add your PIP to it. There is a [template PIP here](pip-tplt.md). Then submit a Pull Request to MattLongCT's [PIPs repository](https://github.com/MattLongCT/PIPs).

# PIP status terms
* **Draft** - a PIP that is open for consideration
* **Accepted** - a PIP that is planned for immediate adoption, i.e. expected to be included in the next hard fork (for Core/Consensus layer PIPs).
* **Final** - a PIP that has been adopted in a previous hard fork (for Core/Consensus layer PIPs).
* **Deferred** - a PIP that is not being considered for immediate adoption. May be reconsidered in the future for a subsequent hard fork.

# Pull Request Template
When opening a pull request to submit a new PIP, please use the suggested template: https://github.com/MattLongCT/PIPs/blob/master/pip-tplt.md

# Issue Template
ATTENTION! If you would like to submit an PIP and it has already been written as a draft (see the [template](https://github.com/MattLongCT/PIPs/blob/master/pip-tplt.md) for an example), please submit it as a [Pull Request](https://github.com/MattLongCT/PIPs/pulls).

If you are considering a proposal but would like to get some feedback on the idea before submitting a draft, then continue opening an Issue as a thread for discussion.  Note that the more clearly and completely you state your idea the higher the quality of the feedback you are likely to receive.

Keep in mind the following guidelines from [PIP-10](https://github.com/MattLongCT/PIPs/blob/master/PIPS/pip-10.md):

> Each PIP must have a champion - someone who writes the PIP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea.

> Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a PIP is meant to save the potential author time. Asking the Peercoin community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the Internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas where Peercoin is used. Examples of appropriate public forums to gauge interest around your PIP include [the Peercoin subreddit], [the Issues section of this repository], and [one of the Peercoin Gitter chat rooms]. In particular, [the Issues section of this repository] is an excellent place to discuss your proposal with the community and start creating more formalized language around your PIP.

> Once the champion has asked the Peercoin community whether an idea has any chance of acceptance a draft PIP should be presented as a [pull request]. This gives the author a chance to continuously edit the draft PIP for proper formatting and quality. This also allows for further public comment and the author of the PIP to address concerns about the proposal.
